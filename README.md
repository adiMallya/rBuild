## Note
- Please open the site on a desktop for better view
- Curently all the scripts are written only for the client-side 
- This site was part of a college assignment, and not for any commercial purpose. 

## Improvements
- TBH this site needs alot of changes :stuck_out_tongue:
- Maybe try making the pages mobile responsive ? Hmm.. :sweat_smile:
- Maybe write better stylesheets ?Nvm I suck at CSS :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
