                      <img src="images/whyrbuild.jpg">
                      <div>
                          <p>A renovation project, in general, can last anywhere from a week all the way to 6 months and sometimes even longer depending on the amount of work needed. If the contractors are not skilled enough, things can go south and turn out to be a disaster, leaving you to pay through the nose. Thus it is important to choose a leading expert with all the right skills for such projects. This is why Housejoy Renovation exists.</p>

                        <h2 id="s2">Stages of Development</h2>

                        <div>
                            <p>A renovation project is carried out in various stages to keep track of the progress and ensure that execution is done correctly. The entire project has to traverse through these stages of renovation i.e. inspection and quotation approval & booking, design (if needed), procurement of raw materials, appointing the labour force & supervisor, execution & monitoring, and handover</p>
                            <h3>Inspection & Quotation Sharing</h3>
                            <p>Home renovation starts with inspecting the house and jotting down all the requirements of the client. After a thorough inspection, the quotation is shared with them.</p>
                            <h3>Approval & Booking</h3>
                            <p>Client’s approval is necessary after the quotation is shared. On approval, the client is required to complete the booking agreement post which the project moves to design/procurement phase.</p>
                            <h3>Design</h3>
                            <p>Once the booking agreement is completed, the project progresses to the next stage i.e. Design. This stage is only required if there is a need for construction of any structure. Expert architects will design a plan and send a request for approval. Henceforth, procurement of raw materials will be done to start the process of execution. If there is no need for design, this stage is skipped and the project directly moves to execution. </p>
                            <h3>Appointing Labour & Superviser</h3>
                            <p> Before starting the execution process, labour force is assigned to the project along with a supervisor to keep track of the progress and monitor the labour force.</p>
                            <h3>Execution & Monitoring</h3>
                            <p>Whether it’s full home renovation, kitchen renovation, bathroom renovation or minor renovation work, daily updates (images and videos) of the progress are provided to the client via Whatsapp. To keep a check on the overall schedule of the project, our supervisor sends a progress report thrice in a week. The raw materials are procured as and when they are needed.</p>
                            <h3>Handover</h3>
                            <p>This is the final stage when the project is completed and the renovated home is handed over to the client.</p>

                        <h2 id="s3">What is the Quality of Materilas we use?</h2>
                        <img src="images/materila.jpg">
                        <div>
                            <p>We give the highest priority to client satisfaction and so we never compromise on the quality of materials used during home or office renovation. From basic sand, bricks, and cement to paint, wood, and electricals, we use the best quality of materials to maintain the highest quality standards. Whether it’s some minor renovation project or a major house renovation project, we make sure to provide the best quality (in both materials and services). Below are the quality standards we use for our raw materials</p>
                            <h3>Bricks</h3>
                            <p> There are various types of bricks used during a renovation project. Red Bricks, Table Moulded Bricks, Wire Cut Bricks, Burnt Clay Bricks, Sand Lime Bricks and Concrete Solid Blocks (sizes ranging between 4”, 6” and 8”) are most commonly used during the process. Housejoy experts recommend using Red Bricks as it provides high compression power, fire resistance, and it can also withstand severe wind and extreme weather conditions. This makes it a suitable construction material.</p>
                            <h3>Cement</h3>
                            <p> There are various types of bricks used during a renovation project. Red Bricks, Table Moulded Bricks, Wire Cut Bricks, Burnt Clay Bricks, Sand Lime Bricks and Concrete Solid Blocks (sizes ranging between 4”, 6” and 8”) are most commonly used during the process. Housejoy experts recommend using Red Bricks as it provides high compression power, fire resistance, and it can also withstand severe wind and extreme weather conditions. This makes it a suitable construction material.</p>
                            <h3>Sand</h3>
                            <p>Sand is an important element to form concrete or cement. M Sand or Natural Sand is used to provide the highest quality of Concrete and Plastering. Our Housejoy experts advice using M Sand during the foundation of the building and Natural Sand at the time of plastering.</p>
                            <h3>Tiles</h3>
                            <p> We provide various tiling options such as Vitrified, Ceramic, Granite, Marble, Italian, etc, for flooring depending on the client’s budget. Housejoy recommends using Ceramic tiles with any kind of finish such as matte, glazed, embossed and textured for bathroom and balcony floorings. For living room, bedroom and other parts of the house, using vitrified tiles is advisable.</p>
                            <h3>Electricals</h3>
                            <p>Electricals are one of the most important works in a home/office or commercial renovation project. If not done correctly, it can be hazardous. Hence Housejoy prioritizes quality and use Finolex cables or a material equivalent to it.</p>
                            <h3>Bathware Fittings</h3>
                            <p>Leaky pipes are annoying and can raise damp wall concerns. To make sure that it does not happen in the future, using high quality of PVC pipes or equivalent quality pipes is recommended by Housejoy experts.</p>

                        <h2 id="s4">Renovation Budget Planning</h2>
                        <img src="images/budget.jpg">
                        <div>
                            <p>It is important to keep track of budget when renovating the house else one can end up spending more money than necessary. Whether it’s complete home renovation or individual parts of the house like kitchen renovation, bathroom renovation, etc; the cost is split into various elements - demolition of unwanted/damaged structures, debris removal, purchase of raw materials for reconstruction, labourers and supervisors.</p>
                            <h3>Know How Much You Can Afford</h3>
                            <p>It is obvious that one cannot spend more than they can afford, but since renovation is a project where money can flow through your pocket like a running river, it is best to keep an end cap to what you have to spend</p>
                            <h3>Know What You Got to do-Requirement Vs Need</h3>
                            <p>Requirement is not always equivalent to need; therefore inspection is carried out to provide assistance to clients on whether they need complete house renovation or just a portion redone. This directly affects the budget and therefore a home inspection is one of the most important things to do before preparing budget.</p>
                            <h3>Payment Plan</h3>
                            <p>A systematic way of payment is equally essential as the budget plan and that’s why we have a unique way of accepting payments to maintain absolute transparency. We only take payments for the amount of real work done, making sure that clients pay only for the work done and nothing more. The payment is divided into several parts based on progress of the project.</p>
